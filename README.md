Step-by-step demo of exposing a local web app securely using Cloudflare Tunnel 

**Author:** Katrin Mrotzeck  
**Type:** Learning / Demonstration Project  
**Tools:** Cloudflare Tunnel, Google Colab  

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to expose a locally running web application
to the public internet using **Cloudflare Tunnel**, without opening inbound ports
or managing traditional infrastructure.

The focus is not only on the technical steps, but also on:
- Clear step-by-step explanations
- Explaining *why* each step exists
- Documenting common issues and learnings

## What this project shows
- How Cloudflare Tunnel works in practice
- How to reason about DNS, security, and request flow
- How to document technical systems for non-technical audiences

## How to use this repository
- Open the notebook: `cloudflare_tunnel_demo.ipynb`
- Read the markdown cells for explanations
- Code cells illustrate the practical setup steps

This notebook is intended as a **conceptual and educational walkthrough**,
not as a production-ready deployment.
